            <p class="small-text">Welcome to my website! My name is Mariyam and I’m happy you’re here. I hope to use this website as a creative outlet and a way to develop my expertise in various areas of knowledge (such as my tech and writing skills)! Here’s a little about me:</p>
            <p class="small-text">I recently completed my Bachelors of Health Sciences in Biochemistry in Canada. During my last couple of years at university, I realized my deep interest in scientific research through working in labs and completing my independent thesis. To further engage my curiosity in research, I am currently working in Research Operations at a research institute. Throughout my professional development, I’ve noticed the increasing need of tech literacy in every sector. I started a web development class earlier this year, which will hopefully equip me with the skills to build my portfolio and advance this website!</p>
            <p class="small-text">While I plan to use this website as my travel blog, there are endless opportunities for what this website could be! Please feel free to connect with me through the ‘Contact Me’ tab.</p>
